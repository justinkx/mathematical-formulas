  calculus: [
    `Nothing takes place in the world whose meaning is not that of some maximum or minimum.― Leonhard Euler`,
    `God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically. - Albert Einstein`,
    `Calculus required continuity, and continuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody could discover what the infinitely little might be. - Bertrand Russell`,
    `I was more interested in skating and the girls and traveling than I was in calculus. - Scott Hamilton`,
    `Love can reach the same level of talent, and even genius, as the discovery of differential calculus. - Lev Vygotsky`,
    `There's a certain point in chemistry and in calculus where I reached the end of my abilities, and I realized, This is where I'm stupid. - Andrew Sean Greer`,
    `The calculus is the greatest aid we have to the application of physical truth in the broadest sense of the word. - William Fogg Osgood`,
    `Calculus is the most powerful weapon of thought yet devised by the wit of man. - Wallace B. Smith`

  'differential calculus': [
    `But how is one to make a scientist understand that there is something unalterably deranged about differential calculus, quantum theory, or the obscene and so inanely liturgical ordeals of the precession of the equinoxes — Antonin Artaud`,
    `The entrancing charm of mathematics, which captivates every one who devotes himself to it, and which is comparable to the fine frenzy under whose ban the poet completes his work, has ever been incomprehensible to the spectator and has often caused the enthusiastic mathematician to be held in derision. A classic illustration is the example of Archimedes. — Emil Lampe`,
    `I'm very good at integral and differential calculus, I know the scientific names of beings animalculous.In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,I am the very model of a modern Major-General. — W.S. Gilbert`,
    `Science is the Differential Calculus of the mind. Art the Integral Calculus; they may be beautiful when apart, but are greatest only when combined.— Sir Ronald Ross`,
    `The invention of the differential calculus marks a crisis in the history of mathematics. The progress of science is divided between periods characterized by a slow accumulation of ideas and periods. - Alfred North Whitehead`
  ],
  algebra: [
    `Algebra and money are essentially levelers; the first intellectually, the second effectively. - Simone Weil`,
    `Algebra is but written geometry and geometry is but figured algebra. -  Sophie Germain`,
    `Algebra is generous; she often gives more than is asked of her. -  Jean le Rond D’Alembert`,
    `Anyone who understands algebraic notation, reads at a glance in an equation results reached arithmetically only with great labour and pains. — Antoine-Augustin Cournot`,
    `As for methods I have sought to give them all the rigour that one requires in geometry, so as never to have recourse to the reasons drawn from the generality of algebra. — Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy`
  ],
  'integral calculus': [
    `I never failed in mathematics. Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and integral calculus. - Albert Einstein`,
    `If one looks at the different problems of the integral calculus which arise naturally when one wishes to go deep into the different parts of physics, it is impossible not to be struck by the analogies existing. - Henri Poincare`,
    `As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. - Albert Einstein`,
    `Science is the Differential Calculus of the mind. Art the Integral Calculus; they may be beautiful when apart, but are greatest only when combined. -Ronald Ross`,
    `In my free time I do differential and integral calculus. - Karl Marx`,
    `The effects of heat are subject to constant laws which cannot be discovered without the aid of mathematical analysis. The object of the theory is to demonstrate these laws; it reduces all physical researches on the propagation of heat, to problems of the integral calculus, whose elements are given by experiment. - Joseph Fourier`
